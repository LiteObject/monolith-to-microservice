# Key goals and motivations to decompose a legacy monolith into microservices:

## Improving Agility and Reducing Time to Market: 
Microservices are independently deployable. This independent nature allows for faster change and release cycles. 
By modeling services around business domains, changes are more likely isolated to a single service boundary, reducing the number of places a change is needed and allowing quicker deployment. 
The ability to work on services in parallel also contributes to faster delivery. This enables continuous integration and continuous delivery practices.
