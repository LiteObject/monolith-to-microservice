# Key goals and motivations to decompose a legacy monolith into microservices:

## Improving Agility and Reducing Time to Market
Microservices are independently deployable. This independent nature allows for faster change and release cycles. 
By modeling services around business domains, changes are more likely isolated to a single service boundary, reducing the number of places a change is needed and allowing quicker deployment. 
The ability to work on services in parallel also contributes to faster delivery. This enables continuous integration and continuous delivery practices.

## Scaling Effectively for Load and Growth
Microservices allow individual services to be scaled independently. This means you only need to scale the parts of the system that are experiencing high load, rather than the entire monolithic application. This can lead to more cost-effective scaling, particularly beneficial for SaaS providers. Breaking apart the monolith provides more capacity for scalability and growth. Microservices maximize scalability and elasticity at a function-level.

## Improving Maintainability
Monoliths often have low maintainability due to technical partitioning, tight coupling, and weak domain cohesion. Decomposing into smaller, functionally cohesive microservices improves maintainability by isolating the scope of changes to individual services. Smaller services are easier for developers to understand and manage. This approach helps reduce architecture erosion.

## Enhancing Robustness, Fault Tolerance, and Availability
By decomposing functionality, the impact of a failure in one service is less likely to bring down the entire system. Microservices provide opportunities to design systems that can better tolerate failures and network issues. Issues in microservices are often more isolated.

## Gaining Technology Flexibility and Enabling New Technology Adoption
Microservices allow process isolation, making it easier to experiment with and adopt different technologies (languages, frameworks, databases) on a service-by-service basis with limited risk to the whole system. This facilitates a gradual migration to newer technology stacks. Architects can choose persistence mechanisms best suited for a specific problem domain.

## Improving Team Autonomy
Microservices can better align with autonomous, stream-aligned teams. This allows for better team autonomy, enabling them to work more effectively and make decisions independently without excessive bureaucracy or coordination. It also helps manage ownership of codebases at scale and can reduce delivery contention.

## Achieving Modernization and Operational Efficiencies
Migration can be driven by a desire for a more modernized architecture. This includes streamlining operations, simplifying DevOps, and gaining better insights into system behavior in production.
