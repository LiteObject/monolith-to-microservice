# What is software architecture?
Software architecture is fundamentally about the important decisions that are hard to change later. It is the structure or shape of a system and the foundational parts.

It is the high-level organization of the system, involving how it is divided into components and how those components interact through interfaces. These components can manifest in various forms, such as microservices or modules within them.

Software architecture happens whether consciously designed or accidentally created through a series of ad hoc decisions. It can also be seen as a social construct, representing a shared understanding of the system design among expert developers.

Unlike the architecture of physical buildings, software architecture must be malleable and capable of changing quickly to meet the rapid pace of business and technology evolution. It is influenced by a plethora of considerations including the business domain, 
functionality, usage scenarios, non-functional requirements (NFRs) or architecture characteristics (often referred to as "-ilities"), devices and channels used to interact with the systems, programming tools, and the infrastructure used to operate them.

Different styles of software architecture exist, such as three-tier, N-tier, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), microservices, and event-driven architecture, among others. SOA, for instance, is described as a design approach where multiple services collaborate.
