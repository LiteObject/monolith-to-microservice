# Monolith to Microservice: A Practical Guide

This repository provides a comprehensive guide for decomposing a legacy monolithic application into microservices, with a focus on notification systems. It covers motivations, migration patterns, domain-driven design (DDD) principles, and both cloud-native and cloud-agnostic architecture options.

## Contents

- **1_Goals.md**  
  Outlines the key goals and motivations for decomposing a monolith, including improved agility, scalability, maintainability, robustness, technology flexibility, team autonomy, and modernization.

- **2_Monolith_to_Microservices.md**  
  Explains what microservices are, the recommended incremental approach to extracting microservices from a monolith, and describes common migration patterns such as Branch by Abstraction, Strangler Fig, Decorating Collaborator, and UI Composition. It also details key considerations for extraction, including data ownership, communication styles, testing, and operational readiness.

- **3_Domain_Driven_Design.md**  
  Describes how Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles help define microservice boundaries, promote independent deployability, encapsulate domain logic, align architecture with organizational structure, and support effective communication and prioritization.

- **4_1_Cloud_Native_Design.md**  
  Presents a cloud-native notification microservice design using AWS managed services (Lambda, SQS, EventBridge, DynamoDB, SES/SNS) and DDD. Focuses on leveraging cloud provider infrastructure for scalability, resilience, and operational efficiency.

- **4_2_Cloud_Agnostic_Design.md**  
  Provides a cloud-agnostic notification microservice design using open standards and portable technologies (e.g., containers, Kafka/RabbitMQ, MongoDB/Postgres, Redis, SMTP/Twilio, MinIO, Prometheus/Grafana). Ensures portability across any cloud or on-premises environment while maintaining strong domain boundaries.

## How to Use

1. **Understand the Why**  
   Start with `1_Goals.md` to clarify your motivations and desired outcomes for migrating to microservices.

2. **Learn the How**  
   Read `2_Monolith_to_Microservices.md` for practical migration strategies, patterns, and step-by-step guidance on extracting services from a monolith.

3. **Design with the Domain in Mind**  
   Use `3_Domain_Driven_Design.md` to apply DDD concepts for defining service boundaries and aligning your architecture with business needs.

4. **Choose Your Architecture**  
   - For AWS or cloud-native environments, see `4_1_Cloud_Native_Design.md`.
   - For multi-cloud or on-premises portability, see `4_2_Cloud_Agnostic_Design.md`.
