# Monolith to Microservice: A Practical Guide

This repository provides a concise, practical guide for decomposing a legacy monolithic application into microservices. It covers the motivations, patterns, and domain-driven design principles essential for a successful migration.

## Contents

- **1_Goals.md**  
  Outlines the key goals and motivations for decomposing a monolith, including improved agility, scalability, maintainability, robustness, technology flexibility, team autonomy, and modernization.

- **2_Monolith_to_Microservices.md**  
  Explains what microservices are, the recommended incremental approach to extracting microservices from a monolith, and describes common migration patterns such as Branch by Abstraction, Strangler Fig, Decorating Collaborator, and UI Composition. It also details key considerations for extraction, including data ownership, communication styles, testing, and operational readiness.

- **3_Domain_Driven_Design.md**  
  Describes how Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles help define microservice boundaries, promote independent deployability, encapsulate domain logic, align architecture with organizational structure, and support effective communication and prioritization.

## How to Use

1. **Understand the Why**  
   Start with `1_Goals.md` to clarify your motivations and desired outcomes for migrating to microservices.

2. **Learn the How**  
   Read `2_Monolith_to_Microservices.md` for practical migration strategies, patterns, and step-by-step guidance on extracting services from a monolith.

3. **Design with the Domain in Mind**  
   Use `3_Domain_Driven_Design.md` to apply DDD concepts for defining service boundaries and aligning your architecture with business needs.
